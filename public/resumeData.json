But with computing power, came the ability to simulate and do more realistic Bayesian Computation. In this talk, we'll talk about how simulating imaginary physical systems help us do that.\n\nWeb Scraping In Bioinformatics -- Nicolas Delgado\n\nDifferent machine learning and virtual screening methodologies demand large inputs of data to reach meaningful results. When the direct download of large databases is not available, web scraping becomes a powerful tool for the retrieving of chemical and biological data. Here, we will see the R package \"rvest\" for the automatisation of processes which would otherwise delay vital results.
