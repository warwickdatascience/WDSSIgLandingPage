It is estimated that, on average, a pharma company spends 10\u201315 years and around $4 billion to bring the new drug to the market. Luckily, machine learning has presented a great opportunity to the biomedical and pharmaceutical companies like AstraZeneca to efficiently access and understand vast amounts of chemical data in very little time.\n\nIn this talk with Astra Zeneca, you will discover how machine learning and data science are used in the pharmaceutical industry. In particular we will discuss: how large biomedical knowledge graphs are used to propose new drug targets; how Bayesian neural networks and probabilistic programming can help improve drug safety; and how image recognition is used in drug discovery.", "timestamp": "2021-02-09T19:07:41+0000", "category": ""}, {"id": "17883707294002990", "media_url": "https://scontent-lcy1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/148190435_447254259759671_7337043029902194568_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=iapNOC8Ew_IAX-UPpzS&_nc_ht=scontent-lcy1-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=c284ecd3c785e1ba10fe8475e926b2f0&oe=60B94519", "caption": "This Thursday we are meeting for our second Code Night with Gather!
