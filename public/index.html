It is hard to think of a more pervasive example of data science than the Tesco Clubcard. With over 20 million users and a rich 25-year history, this simple idea helped propel Tesco to become the UK supermarket goliath that it is today.

In this talk, our speakers will discuss how dunnhumby—the global customer data science firm that founded the Clubcard—has and is still is revolutionising the world of retail using data science, through case studies and examples.

We will also welcome the Global Early Careers Lead to share how you can get involved with the company through their graduate and internship opportunities.

        Halloween is fast approaching, so to mark the occasion, we have invited guests from industry and academia to share tales of the most terrifying thing...bad data *gasp*.
 
Our guests will tell stories of dodgy statistics, corrupt data, and Excel-evil. Not only will you learn about the common pitfalls of data management and how to avoid them in your own work, but you can be entertained whilst doing so.
 
We look forward to seeing you there.

Data science is such a valuable tool, but it can be very pricey! This leaves many organisations that lack funding to struggle to get the best resources and tools. With this, non-profits and charities would find it hard to implement top data science techniques. Nevertheless, they manage to use innovative ways to work round this under their budgets.

In this panel discussion, Christina Last and Chris Mainey will discuss in more details what challenges data scientists face under the tight financial constraints and how this affects their work.

Christina works as a Data Scientist at Skwire, a tech-first real estate company building self-learning AI to create better homes for people and communities. Her most recent work was in collaboration with Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) and UNICEF, serving as the team leader on a project modelling global air quality during the COVID-19 lockdowns.

Chris Mainey is a Senior Data Scientist in health informatics. He is a member of the Healthcare Evaluation Data (HED) team at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB) and leads the development of data science techniques in informatics at UHB. His work focuses on modelling the National Health Service (NHS) data.

Social media is a great tool to understand public sentiment. We can perform all sorts of textual analysis to understand what people think online, giving us a general outlook on public opinions. However, the majority of these approaches do not involve the analysis of emojis, even though—according to a report by the Emoji Research Team of Emogi—92% of the online population use them. 

In this talk, Hamdan Azhar will discuss how he became known for his work in emoji data science and the founding of PRISMOJI. He currently works as the VP of Research, Analytics and Data at Blackrock, with previous experience at Facebook as the co-inventor on their granted patent on emoji machine learning.

        We will wrap up our Python subject example by turning to physics and engineering.

This examples uses a Kalman filter to predict the position of a falling ball even in the presence of process and measurement noise. This same technique is used in several self-driving car systems yet we can comfortably produce it after just a few weeks learning Python.

        For our next Python subject example we move from politics to pure mathematics.

For this example, we used Python techniques from WDSS's beginners' course to visualise the slopes of a 3D surface.

        WDSS has recently finished our first wave of Python teaching. In just 8 weeks we have covered an awful lot, and it's time to see that put to good use.

As promised, we've created 5 examples, showcasing how the Python material covered in our introductory course can be used to tackle some amazing, interdisciplinary problems.

We'll start off with Politics, with a visualisation showing which US states are the most gerrymandered.

        We were wondering what sort of music our exec listened to...we used data science to find out. Now it's your turn to create your own personal, interactive, Spotify visualisation. 

At 4pm on the 16th September we will be running a data science taster workshop as part of pre-welcome week. In this, we will walk through how you can create your own 'wall of music' just like ours below, featuring your favourite songs, arranged using machine learning to place similar sounding songs next to each other. 

No coding experience is required and everything will be done on the cloud, so there will be no faffy software setup. To make things even easier, we will have split the workshop up with small breakout rooms where our teaching assistants can help you get your code working. 

Places are limited so sign-up by following the link in our bio.

        We care about finding exec members that are passionate about what they do, so we can best help WDSS to benefit as many students as possible.

Even if you aren't a data scientist, if you can help in this goal, we want your support. We are currently recruiting for both a Graphic Design and Marketing Officer, and we are looking for students that can thrive in these positions, regardless of their technical interest in data science.

If you or someone you know has a talent for either role, applications and further details can be found by following the link in our bio (deadline 7th September).

        WDSS is looking for five subject ambassadors to join our team and support us in creating a truly interdisciplinary society

There is no required skill level in coding or data science; rather, all we want are students passionate about data science and the work WDSS is doing, with strong links and domain knowledge in one of the five advertised fields. Data science/coding experience is a great bonus too.

The role will involve supporting the translation of teaching material to specific domains, helping to bridge the gap between technologists and domain experts for research projects (with the option to lead projects for yourself), and arranging collaborations with other academic societies. That said, we are flexible on what exactly these roles entail, so please reach out if you have other ideas too.

To apply, email hello@warwickdatascience.com before 2nd September with: - The role you wish to apply for - A short paragraph about your relation to that subject - A short paragraph about your interest in data science/WDSS
