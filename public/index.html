        We will wrap up our Python subject example by turning to physics and engineering.

This examples uses a Kalman filter to predict the position of a falling ball even in the presence of process and measurement noise. This same technique is used in several self-driving car systems yet we can comfortably produce it after just a few weeks learning Python.

        WDSS has recently finished our first wave of Python teaching. In just 8 weeks we have covered an awful lot, and it's time to see that put to good use.

As promised, we've created 5 examples, showcasing how the Python material covered in our introductory course can be used to tackle some amazing, interdisciplinary problems.

We'll start off with Politics, with a visualisation showing which US states are the most gerrymandered.

        We were wondering what sort of music our exec listened to...we used data science to find out. Now it's your turn to create your own personal, interactive, Spotify visualisation. 

At 4pm on the 16th September we will be running a data science taster workshop as part of pre-welcome week. In this, we will walk through how you can create your own 'wall of music' just like ours below, featuring your favourite songs, arranged using machine learning to place similar sounding songs next to each other. 

No coding experience is required and everything will be done on the cloud, so there will be no faffy software setup. To make things even easier, we will have split the workshop up with small breakout rooms where our teaching assistants can help you get your code working. 

Places are limited so sign-up by following the link in our bio.

        We care about finding exec members that are passionate about what they do, so we can best help WDSS to benefit as many students as possible.

Even if you aren't a data scientist, if you can help in this goal, we want your support. We are currently recruiting for both a Graphic Design and Marketing Officer, and we are looking for students that can thrive in these positions, regardless of their technical interest in data science.

If you or someone you know has a talent for either role, applications and further details can be found by following the link in our bio (deadline 7th September).

        WDSS is looking for five subject ambassadors to join our team and support us in creating a truly interdisciplinary society

There is no required skill level in coding or data science; rather, all we want are students passionate about data science and the work WDSS is doing, with strong links and domain knowledge in one of the five advertised fields. Data science/coding experience is a great bonus too.

The role will involve supporting the translation of teaching material to specific domains, helping to bridge the gap between technologists and domain experts for research projects (with the option to lead projects for yourself), and arranging collaborations with other academic societies. That said, we are flexible on what exactly these roles entail, so please reach out if you have other ideas too.

To apply, email hello@warwickdatascience.com before 2nd September with: - The role you wish to apply for - A short paragraph about your relation to that subject - A short paragraph about your interest in data science/WDSS

        Everyone has their theories on what led to Trump's surprise victory in the 2016 presidential election, but what does data science have to say on the matter? In this post, political science meets data science, as three WDSS members collaborate to model and analyse what factors led to Trump's 2016 election victory. In doing this we corroborate several existing beliefs, but more importantly, cast doubt on many common theories, that have yet to be analysed in a data-centric manner. Critically, we explain how our results are likely to influence the upcoming 2020 election. Read more at: https://link.wdss.io/trump

        Imagine a virtual quiz night that actually felt social and interactive. A chance to meet new people, have fun, and show off your trivia skills.

If this sounds like your sort of thing, join WDSS on 21st August for our virtual quiz night. We are doing things differently, taking advantage of Zoom's breakout rooms and bringing in a guest Quiz Master, to make the event as engaging as possible. All are welcome as the bulk of the quiz will be on general knowledge, but this is also a great chance to meet our exec and other students interested in data science.

To sign-up, pop your email in this form:

        Introducing our new WDSS Mini Talk series! With this, we plan to give a voice to students who want to share ideas or projects that they are passionate about. For our first talk of the series, we plan to showcase a technology that we have all heard of but may not fully understand, blockchain. The technology is a vital tool used in many aspects of finance and other fields, but many people are still not aware of what is going on underneath. Our speaker for this talk is Raul-Octavian Rus, a Mathematics and Statistics Graduate from the University of Warwick with an incoming master's at the University of Cambridge. Having previously worked as a quant researcher on the buy-side and an equity derivatives intern on the sell-side, he plans to break the hype and show you how easy it is to create your very own blockchain, all in half an hour! We look forward to seeing you on YouTube via the following link: https://youtu.be/awhQOKxA8FE

        How can such a seemingly obvious answer to a finance question result in an adversary swindling you for infinite money?
 
In this short post, WDSS Outreach Officer Yasser Qureshi breaks down a fascinating paradox from the world of arbitrage, with an introductory section for those new to the field. This is an insightful example of how our initial instincts about data and statistics leave us open to exploitation in finance. Read the post at the following link.

        Have you noticed that Warwick's Biological Sciences course has been soaring up through the Complete University Guide league table over the past decade?

We wouldn't blame you if not. All popular league tables only showcase the current year's rankings by default and only allow access to old data in clunky tables and spreadsheets. At WDSS, we thought this was a terrible waste of fascinating data, so we decided to collect over 45,000 historic measurements across 187 universities and 70 courses, and visualise them in an interactive web app to make it easy to find patterns. You can have a look for yourself at this link:

        We now move to Janique Krasnowska who will be taking over the role of Research Officer.

Janique has recently started a placement year for the pharmaceutical company Parexel and works as a biostatistician on clinical trials. Upon returning, she complete the final year of her integrated master’s degree in Mathematics and Statistics.

While working on a natural language processing project at Accenture last summer, she realised how powerful and accessible statistical programming can be. Since then, she focused on applying machine learning to real life datasets, such as in recent work in which she used k-nearest neighbour missing values imputation to model the uptake of influenza vaccinations.

As of late, she has participated in a WDSS research project, aiming to better visualise the change in university rankings over the past 15 years. A write up for this work can be found here:

        Here we have Yasser Qureshi, an incoming 3rd-year Systems Engineering student who is our new Outreach/Talks Officer. 

Yasser has been active in the society since November 2019, undertaking roles in the previous Research and Outreach Teams, notably assisting in our largest on-campus event with Quantum Black. His passion to learn more about data science stems from some of his early work experience at large engineering and logistic companies, where he witnessed path optimisation, life-cycle predictions and early adoption of automated machinery. As such, he wants to provide understanding and knowledge of how data science can be leveraged in every domain and through his role, aims to create a large network of students, lecturers, alumni and industry leaders.

He has recently written an article for WDSS's research blog, discussing a paradox related to the topic of financial arbitrage. You can read it here:

        Introducing Ciaran Evans—our new Vice President.

Ciaran is an incoming Data Analytics Master's student. From interning in both a consultancy and investment firm, he's seen first-hand the power of data science in transforming everything from market risk to regulatory compliance in the financial services industry.

He also spent 12 months working for an education charity where he saw the disparity of access to data science teaching opportunities across the UK. For him, widening access to technology education is a key priority.

With an interest in applying data science to niche disciplines, he recently authored a blog for WDSS's research website, showcasing how data science techniques can be used to form insight into the history of UK cities:
